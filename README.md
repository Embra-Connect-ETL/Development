Welcome to **Embra Connect**!

Think of Embra Connect like a universal power strip for IoT and edge device data pipelines. Just like a power strip lets you plug in and manage multiple devices effortlessly, Embra Connect provides a unified way to connect, process, and orchestrate data from different edge devicesâ€”whether you're a hobbyist tinkering in your garage or a professional deploying at scale. You can set it up yourself for full control or use the managed version for a plug-and-play experience.
